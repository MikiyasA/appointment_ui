✅ Solution: Add Your Google Account as a Test User
Go to Google Cloud Console

Open your OAuth consent screen:
From the left sidebar: APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen
Under "Test users", add the Gmail address you're trying to use:

frehiwotnegashkwi@gmail.com

Click Save and Continue
You can now sign in and test the app using this account.

🛠 Optional: Move to Production (for broader access)
To allow any user to sign in (not just test accounts), you must:
Click "Publish App" on the OAuth consent screen page.
Complete the OAuth verification process with Google (takes 3–7 days).

This involves:
Verifying your domain (if applicable)
Providing a privacy policy URL
Explaining why your app needs sensitive scopes like calendar

🧪 Tip: Stay in Testing While Developing
You can add up to 100 test users in testing mode.

All test users must use Gmail or Google Workspace emails.
